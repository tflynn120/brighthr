How to run the application:

- npm run dev

How to run the tests:

- npm run test

Functionality:

- Allow a user to open a folder to see itâ€™s contents
- Sort by name/size/date
- Filter by filename

If I was given more time/reflections:

- When opening a folder, instead of showing only the contents within that selected folder, I think if I were to do this exercise again I would rather just display those files underneath with an expand option
- Possibly add functionality with the search bar to also search for doc types and dates
- More effort with the styling
